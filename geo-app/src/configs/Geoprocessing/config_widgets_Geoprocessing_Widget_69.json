GREAT_CIRCLE—A type of geodetic line which represents the path between any two points along the intersection of the surface of the earth and a plane that passes through the center of the earth. Depending on the output coordinate system specified by the Spatial Reference parameter, in a spheroid-based coordinate system, the line is a great elliptic; in a sphere-based coordinate system, the line is uniquely called a great circle—a circle of the largest radius on the spherical surface. RHUMB_LINE—A type of geodetic line, also known as a loxodrome line, which represents a path between any two points on the surface of a spheroid defined by a constant azimuth from a pole. A rhumb line is shown as a straight line in the Mercator projection. NORMAL_SECTION—A type of geodetic line which represents a path between any two points on the surface of a spheroid defined by the intersection of the spheroid surface and a plane that passes through the two points and is normal (perpendicular) to the spheroid surface at the starting point of the two points.
